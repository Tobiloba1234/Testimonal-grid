This is a screenshot of the site with the grid layout. The site will be static and visible to anyone but the user I will keep improving my skills so I can make it interactive.

## My process
This project made me become stronger  and learn more because I always ran away from the grid. After all, it was kind of confusing for me to grasp the concept and implement it accurately into my code. But this project made me face my fear and keep researching articles and watching videos. What I would do differently was search for solutions immediately at a particular aspect.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I encountered a challenge when I had to use what I learned previously about grids on the page because learning and doing something is quite different. I was able to overcome this by rewatching videos and trying to do it step by step.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container{
    display:grid;
    height:100%;
    column-gap:30px;
    row-gap:30px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat (12, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(1,400px);
    grid-template-areas: 
    "d d d d d d d d d d d d"
    "j j j j j j j j j j j j"
    "h h h h h h h h h h h h"
    "p p p p p p p p p p p p"
    "k k k k k k k k k k k k" ;
  }
```


### Continued development

My skills are still limited but I want to learn javascript,react and also dab into backend, and web 3.I am always willing to get feedback and improve myself, so if any part of my page looks off or needs improvement I will be very happy to get responses from various people.
